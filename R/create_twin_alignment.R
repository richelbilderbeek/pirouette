#' Creates a twin alignment.
#'
#' A twin alignment is an alignment that has as much acquired
#' the same number of mutations (compared to the root sequence),
#' as the true alingment has (compared to the root sequence).
#'
#' When an alignment gets very big, say one million base pairs,
#' it will take long to get a twin alignment with exactly the same
#' number of mutations.
