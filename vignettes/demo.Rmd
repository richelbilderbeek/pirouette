```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

The goal of `pirouette` is to estimate the error BEAST2 makes from a known 
phylogeny. This phylogeny can be created using a non-BEAST speciation model,
for example the PBD or MBD models.

```{r}
library(pirouette)
```

```{r}
if (!mauricer::is_beast2_pkg_installed("NS")) {
  mauricer::install_beast2_pkg("NS")
}
```

In this demo, we use a simple 'true' phylogeny:

```{r}
true_phylogeny <- ape::read.tree(text = "(((A:1, B:1):1, C:2):1, D:3);")
ape::plot.phylo(true_phylogeny, main = "The 'true' phylogeny")
```

As this vignette is a demo (and not a thorough research), 
we'll use a short alignment:

```{r}
alignment_params <- create_alignment_params(
  root_sequence = create_blocked_dna(length = 20),
  mutation_rate = 1.0 / beautier:::get_phylo_crown_age(true_phylogeny)
)
```

Also the inference is kept short, using a short MCMC chain:

```{r}
inference_param <- create_inference_param(
    mcmc = beautier::create_mcmc(chain_length = 2000, store_every = 1000)
)
```

## Only use the generative model in inference

There are multiple ways to select for an inference model.
In the simplest case, which is the default, 
we will do our inference with the generative model only:

```{r}
model_select_params <- list(
  create_gen_model_select_param(
    alignment_params = alignment_params
  )
)
```

Here we measure the baseline error: the error that BEAST2 makes
when the inference model is the correct generative 
model (JC69 and strict clock):

```{r}
errors <- pir_run(
  true_phylogeny,
  alignment_params = alignment_params,
  model_select_params = model_select_params,
  inference_param = inference_param
)
```

Here we show the errors as a table:

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(errors))
```

Here we plot the error:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=7}
pir_plot(errors)
```

## Do inference with the generative and model with most evidence

Again, there are multiple ways to select for which inference model(s)
to use. Next to the known generative model (JC69 and strict clock),
here we use the inference model that has the highest evidence (also
called 'marginal likelihood'). 

Here we measure the baseline error, from the generative model,
and the error that BEAST2 makes
when the inference model is the one with most evidence:

```{r}
model_select_params = list(
  create_gen_model_select_param(
    alignment_params = alignment_params
  ),
  create_best_model_select_param(
    site_models = beautier::create_site_models()[3],
    clock_models = beautier::create_clock_models()[2],
    tree_priors = beautier::create_tree_priors()[5]
  )
)
```

Note that we select the model with the heighest evidence from a set of
just one model (JC69, strict, Yule).

Run this setup:

```{r}
errors <- pir_run(
  true_phylogeny,
  alignment_params = alignment_params,
  model_select_params = model_select_params,
  inference_param = inference_param
)
```

Here we show the errors as a table:

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(errors))
```

Here we plot the error:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=7}
pir_plot(errors)
```
