\title{Create all \link{pirouette} experiments that have a tree prior
that follows a birth-death model.}
\usage{
create_all_bd_experiments(
  site_models = beautier::create_site_models(),
  clock_models = beautier::create_clock_models(),
  tree_priors = list(beautier::create_bd_tree_prior(),
    beautier::create_yule_tree_prior()),
  mcmc = beautier::create_mcmc(store_every = 1000),
  exclude_model = NA
)
}
\arguments{
\item{site_models}{a list of one or more site models,
as created by \link[beautier]{create_site_model}}

\item{clock_models}{a list of one or more clock models,
as created by \link[beautier]{create_clock_model}}

\item{tree_priors}{a list of one or more tree priors,
as created by \link[beautier]{create_tree_prior}}

\item{mcmc}{MCMC options, as created by \link[beautier]{create_mcmc}}

\item{exclude_model}{an inference model that has to be excluded, as can be
created by \link[beautier]{create_inference_model}}
}
\value{
all \link{pirouette} experiments.
}
\description{
These tree priors are both the pure-birth (or Yule) model (as
created by \link[beautier]{create_yule_tree_prior}) and the
constant-rate birth-death model (as
created by \link[beautier]{create_bd_tree_prior}).
}
\details{
These experiments are used in the \link{create_pir_params} function
}
\examples{
if (rappdirs::app_dir()$os != "win" && beautier::is_on_github_actions()) {

  pir_params <- create_pir_params(
    alignment_params = create_test_alignment_params(),
    experiments = experiments,
    evidence_filename = get_temp_evidence_filename()
  )

\itemize{
  \item Use \link{create_all_experiments} to create experiments with
    all combinations of tree model, clock model and tree priors
  \item Use \link{create_all_bd_experiments} to create experiments
    with all combinations of tree model, clock model and tree priors,
    except for only using birth-death tree priors
  \item Use \link{create_all_coal_experiments} to create all experiments
    with all combinations of tree model, clock model and tree priors,
    except for only coalescent tree priors
