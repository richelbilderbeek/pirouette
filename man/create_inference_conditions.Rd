\usage{
create_inference_conditions(model_type = "generative",
  run_if = "always", do_measure_evidence = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_type}{type of inference model supplied for an experiment.
Possible values:
\itemize{
  \item \code{generative}: the inference model is (or is assumed to be)
    the inference model underlying the phylogeny
  \item \code{candidate}: the inference model is a candidate model,
    that competes with other models for having the most
    evidence (aka highest marginal likelihood)
}}

\item{run_if}{the condition for an experiment's inference model to be run.
Possible values:
\itemize{
  \item \code{always}: always
  \item \code{best_candidate}: if the inference model is the
    candidate model with the most evidence (aka highest marginal
    likelihood)
}}

\item{do_measure_evidence}{boolean to indicate if the
evidence (aka marginal likelihood) of an experiment must be
measured}
}
