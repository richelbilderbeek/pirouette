\title{Check that generative and candidate experiments save to
different files.}
\usage{
check_gen_and_cand_exps_save_to_different_files(experiments)
}
\arguments{
\item{experiments}{a list of one or more \link{pirouette} experiments,
as can be created by \link{create_experiment}. If more than one experiment
is provided and a "generative" experiment is part of them, the "generative"
one has to be the first in the list. See also:
\itemize{
  \item Use \link{check_experiments} to check the list of
    experiments for validity
  \item Use \link{create_all_experiments} to create experiments with
    all combinations of tree model, clock model and tree priors
  \item Use \link{create_all_bd_experiments} to create experiments
    with all combinations of tree model, clock model and tree priors,
    except for only using birth-death tree priors
  \item Use \link{create_all_coal_experiments} to create all experiments
    with all combinations of tree model, clock model and tree priors,
    except for only coalescent tree priors
  \item Use \link{shorten_experiments} to shorten the run time
    of the list of experiments
