\usage{
count_n_mutations(alignment, root_sequence)

\item{alignment}{a DNA alignment}

\item{root_sequence}{the DNA sequence at the root of the phylogeny.
By default, this will consist out of an equal amount of each letter}
}

library(testthat)

# Create an AAAA alignent

)

# Count the number of mutations from AAAA
expect_equal(count_n_mutations(alignment, "aaaa"), 0)
