\title{Measure the error BEAST2 makes from a known phylogeny.}
\usage{
pir_run(phylogeny, alignment_params,
  model_select_params = create_gen_model_select_param(alignment_params),
  inference_params)
}
\arguments{
\item{phylogeny}{a phylogeny of class \link[ape]{phylo}}

\item{alignment_params}{parameters to simulate an alignment,
as can be created by \link{create_alignment_params}}

\item{model_select_params}{a list of one or more parameter sets
to select an inference model
(a combination of site model, clock model and tree prior),
as can be created by \link{create_model_select_param}}

\item{inference_params}{parameters for the Bayesian inference,
as can be created by \link{create_inference_params}.
The Bayesian inference is handled by the \link[babette]{babette}
R package, that calls the phylogenetic tool \code{BEAST2}.}

\item{alignment_filename}{name of the file a simulated alignment is
saved to. By default, this file will cleaned up by the
operating system}
}
\value{
a data frame with errors, with as many rows as model selection
  parameter sets
}
\description{
From a phylogeny of (un)known speciation model,
an alignment is created using a known site model and clock model,
as given by \code{alignment_params}.
}
\details{
From each of the one or more model selection parameters in
\code{model_select_params}, one inference model is concluded.
One such parameter setup is to use the generative site and clock model
the alignment is created with (\code{"generative"}), or use the model
that has the most evidence (\code{"most evidence"}).

Each inference model is used to run BEAST2 and measures the
difference between the known/true/given phylogeny and the
ones created by BEAST2.
