\title{Check that the candidate experiments have a same MCMC}
\usage{
check_experiments_candidates_have_same_mcmcs(experiments)
}
\arguments{
\item{experiments}{a list of one or more \link{pirouette} experiments,
as can be created by \link{create_experiment}. If more than one experiment
is provided and a "generative" experiment is part of them, the "generative"
one has to be the first in the list.}
}
\description{
If all the candidates share a same MCMC, they share the same
tracelog and treelog. In this way, one can predict where the parameter
estimates (the trace) and posterior trees are written to, as only the
best candidate will run.
