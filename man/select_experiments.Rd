\title{Select the experiments to do a Bayesian inference with.}
\usage{
select_experiments(experiments = list(create_test_experiment()),
  marg_liks = NULL, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{experiments}{a list of one or more \link{pirouette} experiments,
as can be created by \link{create_experiment}. If more than one experiment
is provided and a "generative" experiment is part of them, the "generative"
one has to be the first in the list.}

\item{marg_liks}{a data frame with marginal likelihoods/evidences.
A test data frame can be created by \link{create_test_marg_liks}}

\item{verbose}{if TRUE, show more output}
}
\value{
a list of inference models
}

Select the experiments to do a Bayesian inference with.
